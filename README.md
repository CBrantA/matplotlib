# Matplotlib Analysis

*For this exercise, I took two CSV files and analyzed the data - checking for and removing any duplications after merging the two data sets.

* Next I generated a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

* I generated bar plots using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that show the number of mice per time point for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.

* I also generated a pie plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

* I generated a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

* I generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

* Finally I calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.

* My Observations are recorded at the top of notebook.
